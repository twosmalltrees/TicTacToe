# Tic Tac Toe

Who doesn't love a good game of tic tac toe? Especially against an unbeatable computer opponent! Play a few rounds now at [http://twosmalltrees.github.io/TicTacToe/](http://twosmalltrees.github.io/TicTacToe/).

This simple game uses only basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). However it's got some fun built in features:

### Human vs. Human

You can play against a friend (or yourself) in this traditional version.

### Human vs Computer

Alternatively if you prefer more of a challenge, take on the computer! You get the first move, but rumour has it that the computer has never been beaten on a 3x3 board... To toggle between the two modes just click the appropriate link above the board.

### Adjust Board Size

You're also able to adjust the board size, with three options available:
* 3x3
* 4x4
* 5x5

You can toggle between these board sizes via the links below the board.

### Enjoy!

Well, that's it from me. Have fun!

Harrison.
